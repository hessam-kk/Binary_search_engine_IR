# Binary_search_engine_IR
A binary search engine implementation for the Information Retrieval course

# Introduction

This project involves building a search engine for searching in multiple
documents. The main objective of this project was to develop a tool that can
quickly and accurately search for a specific word or phrase in a collection of
documents and return the relevant results. To achieve this, I implemented a
posting list that stores the terms and their corresponding documents. This
allowed the search engine to efficiently index and retrieve the documents that
contain the search term. Overall, this project provided me with valuable
experience in developing information retrieval systems and utilizing data
structures for efficient search operations.
